# Automated-Amazon-Price-Tracker---Web-scraping
Amazon Product Scraper is a Python tool that extracts product names and prices from Amazon pages. It uses BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing, rotates user agents to avoid detection, handles errors gracefully, logs activities for debugging, saves data to a text file, and includes rate-limiting for stealth.
